				<p>
					My name's Shane Chatterton, and I started Fluid Plumbing with one goal: to offer quality plumbing services
					at fair prices, without the upsells, gimmicks, or shortcuts I saw working for other companies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before going out on my own, I'd meet homeowners in stressful situations, from leaks to breakdowns to flooded
					basements, and I couldn't help them the way I wanted to because of company policies or sales quotas. That
					didn't sit right with me. So I started this business to do things differently.
				</p>
				<p>
					At Fluid Plumbing, we take the time to <strong>do the job right the first time</strong> &mdash; no rush jobs,
					no patchwork. I treat every customer like family and only recommend work that's truly needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					We work throughout <strong>Kettering, Dayton, and the surrounding areas</strong>, handling everything from
					clogged drains and pipe repairs to full water heater installs.
				</p>
				<p>
					I live right here in Kettering with my wife and two daughters. I'm big on family, big on fishing, and built
					this business from the ground up with the kind of work ethic you develop when you grow up knowing exactly
					who you don't want to be.

		},
		{
			question: 'Do I need a plumber for a clogged drain?',
			answer: "Yes — especially if store-bought drain cleaners aren't working. A professional plumber can clear blockages without damaging your pipes and help prevent future issues."
		},
		{
			question: 'How do I know if my water heater needs replaced?',
			answer: "If your water heater is over 10 years old, leaking, or not heating properly, it may be time to replace it. We can inspect it and help you decide what's best for your home and budget."
		},
		{
			question: 'What areas do you service?',
			answer: 'We proudly serve homeowners in Kettering, Dayton, Centerville, Oakwood, Riverside, and surrounding areas in the Miami Valley.'
		},
		{
			question: "What's the benefit of hiring a licensed plumber?",
			answer: 'Licensed plumbers bring experience, safety, and peace of mind. We know local codes, use the right tools, and stand behind our work with warranties and clear communication.'
		},
		{
			question: 'Do you offer emergency plumbing services?',
			answer: "Yes! We offer fast-response plumbing for urgent issues like water leaks, burst pipes, or failing water heaters. Don't wait-call us, and we'll make it right."
		},
		{
			question: 'How much does a typical plumbing job cost?',
			answer: 'It depends on the job, but we keep pricing transparent. We offer up-front quotes with no hidden fees — plus $50 off for first-time customers and seasonal deals like $300 off water heater installs.'
		},
		{
			question: 'Can you help with low water pressure?',
			answer: "Absolutely. We'll inspect your system to find the cause — whether it's buildup, leaks, or valve issues and get your water flowing again."
		},
		{
			question: 'How do I prevent frozen pipes in the winter?',
			answer: "Insulate pipes in cold areas, disconnect hoses, and let faucets drip when temps drop. Need help winterizing... We've got you covered."
		},
		{
			question: 'Do you offer estimates?',
			answer: "Yes — we provide free, no-obligation estimates for all residential plumbing work. You'll know exactly what to expect before we begin."

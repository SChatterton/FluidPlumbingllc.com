The **Komatsu D65 Bulldozer** is engineered for powerful earthmoving, exceptional durability, and outstanding fuel efficiency. Designed for performance in rough terrain, the D65 is a preferred choice for contractors needing reliable grading, site clearing, and high-volume material pushing.

With its rugged undercarriage and robust engine, this bulldozer maintains stable traction even in challenging conditions. Operators appreciate its smooth control response, ergonomic cab, and advanced hydraulic system that enhances blade precision and overall productivity.

## High-Performance Powertrain  
Komatsu’s Tier 4 Final engine delivers impressive torque and reduced emissions. The D65 maintains consistent pushing capability with minimal fuel consumption, allowing crews to move more material at a lower cost.

The automatic transmission and advanced torque converter further enhance machine efficiency by delivering responsive power delivery, whether operating on slopes, mud, or granular soil.

### Fuel Efficiency Technology  
The built-in Komatsu Eco Gauge helps operators maintain fuel-efficient operation without sacrificing productivity.

## Blade Performance & Versatility  
The D65 is equipped with a high-capacity blade designed for rough grading, bulk material movement, and precision finishing. The hydraulic system ensures consistent response, while the strengthened blade structure withstands heavy workloads.

In addition to raw strength, the bulldozer delivers precise control, allowing operators to shape terrain with accuracy. The machine’s balance and weight distribution provide optimal traction for both uphill and downhill operations.

### Perfect for Large-Scale Earthmoving  
From construction sites to mining support applications, the D65 handles demanding earthmoving tasks with ease.

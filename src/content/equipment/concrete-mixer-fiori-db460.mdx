The **Fiori DB460 Concrete Mixer** is a versatile self-loading mixer designed for efficient concrete production on-site. Its compact size and agility make it ideal for tight construction areas, remote jobs, and fast-paced concrete operations.

The DB460 allows crews to mix concrete directly where it's needed, reducing delays from batch plant deliveries and improving concrete quality through immediate placement.

## Efficient Mixing System  
The 4.0 m³ drum provides excellent mixing performance due to its optimized spirals and high-speed rotation. Operators can adjust water dosage, mix timing, and drum speed to produce concrete that meets specific project requirements.

The machine’s integrated weighing system ensures consistent material proportions, resulting in superior mix uniformity and reduced waste. This makes the DB460 especially useful for demanding structural or roadwork applications.

### Self-Loading Design  
The front bucket loads sand, gravel, and cement directly into the drum, reducing labor and improving daily output.

## Mobility & Operation  
Its 4x4 traction system and articulated steering allow the mixer to navigate rough, uneven terrain with ease. This mobility is ideal for hillside work, off-road construction sites, and remote infrastructure projects.

The operator cab provides excellent visibility, ergonomic controls, and safety features such as rollover protection and emergency stops.

### Ideal for Remote & Fast Work  
Where batch plants are unavailable or unreliable, the DB460 ensures continuous, high-quality concrete supply.

The **Liebherr LTM Mobile Crane** is known worldwide for its exceptional lifting capability, advanced safety features, and outstanding mobility. Designed for fast setup and efficient operation, it is ideal for construction, industrial maintenance, infrastructure work, and precision lifting applications.

Its all-terrain chassis allows the crane to travel across highways and rough jobsite environments alike. The strong telescopic boom and intelligent load management system ensure stability and accuracy during lifting operations.

## Telescopic Boom & Lifting System  
Equipped with an advanced hydraulic telescopic boom, the LTM crane can handle a variety of lifting tasks with excellent precision and power. The boom’s multi-section design provides strong load charts and a wide working radius.

The crane’s load moment system monitors safety parameters in real-time, ensuring secure and controlled lifting even near maximum capacity limits.

### Fast Setup and High Mobility  
The hydraulic outriggers deploy quickly, allowing operators to start lifting operations sooner — maximizing project efficiency.

## Operator Comfort & Safety Systems  
Featuring a modern climate-controlled cab, clear visibility, and ergonomic controls, the LTM ensures comfortable and precise operation. Safety features such as anti-two block protection, load-moment indicators, and swing restriction systems are standard.

These technologies reduce risk and support safe operation in complex work environments, ensuring compliance with strict lifting standards.

### Ideal for Industrial & Construction Lifts  
From placing structural steel to installing HVAC units, the LTM excels in both heavy and precise lift scenarios.

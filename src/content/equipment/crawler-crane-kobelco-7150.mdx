The **Kobelco 7150 Crawler Crane** is engineered for heavy lifting, long-reach operations, and demanding construction environments. With its 150-ton capacity and excellent on-site mobility, this crane is ideal for infrastructure, industrial plants, and large-scale civil engineering projects.

The crawler undercarriage provides outstanding stability, allowing the crane to lift heavy loads without requiring outriggers. This makes it especially effective for uneven terrain, tight spaces, and long lift durations.

## High-Capacity Lifting System  
The crane’s hydraulic boom and lattice extension provide exceptional lifting height and reach. With its precision control system, operators can position loads smoothly and accurately, even in complex lifting scenarios.

The advanced load management system continuously monitors crane stability, ensuring safe lifting operations. Its intelligent sensors provide real-time feedback to reduce operational risks and increase jobsite efficiency.

### Smooth Travel & Stability  
The crawler tracks distribute weight evenly, providing mobility and stable operation without the need for ground pads or external supports.

## Operator Comfort & Controls  
The Kobelco 7150 features an ergonomic cab with excellent visibility, reducing fatigue and increasing operator confidence. The control layout is designed for intuitive operation, making complex lifts safer and more predictable.

In addition, the climate-controlled environment and vibration-dampening systems enhance comfort during long shifts. Operators can rely on clear digital readouts for load charts, boom angles, and safety indicators.

### Ideal for Major Lifting Projects  
From bridge beams to industrial equipment installations, the 7150 delivers the reliable power needed for heavy-duty lifting assignments.

For long-term rentals, specialized machinery, or operator-included services,
additional requirements or agreements may apply.

### 2.1 Cancellation Policy

Cancellations must follow the terms communicated during the booking process.
Late cancellations may result in cancellation fees or forfeiture of deposits due

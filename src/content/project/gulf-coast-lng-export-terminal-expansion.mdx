The Gulf Coast LNG Export Terminal Expansion is a high-complexity megaproject designed to support rapidly increasing global demand for liquefied natural gas. Once complete, the expansion will increase export capacity by **40%**, strengthen U.S. energy independence, and improve international trade reliability.

---

## Civil & Earthworks
- 1.7 million cubic yards excavated  
- Ground improvement using deep-soil mixing  
- Flood-resilient platform construction  
- Coastal erosion control infrastructure  

---

## LNG Storage & Cryogenic Engineering
The heart of the expansion is the construction of **two 220,000 m³ cryogenic storage tanks**.

### Key Features
- 9% nickel steel inner tanks  
- Reinforced concrete outer shells  
- Advanced thermal insulation  
- Automated leak-detection systems  

---

## Marine Loading Facilities
To accommodate increased export traffic:
- Two new loading berths  
- Reinforced mooring dolphins  
- High-capacity loading arms  
- Digital ship-tracking systems  

Marine crews coordinate closely with port authorities to ensure environmental compliance.

---

## Pipeline & Mechanical Systems
The expansion includes:
- 14 miles of cryogenic-grade pipeline  
- Compression stations  
- Gas treatment facilities  
- Control rooms with real-time monitoring  

---

## Safety & Environmental Commitment
- Active air-quality sensors  
- Spill-prevention berms  
- Wetland restoration zones  
- Hurricane-rated structures  

The project maintains **zero environmental violations**.

---

## Workforce & Equipment
- **Peak workforce**: 1,150 personnel  
- **Safety rating**: 99% compliance  
- **Equipment fleet**: Cranes, pipe layers, excavators, marine barges
